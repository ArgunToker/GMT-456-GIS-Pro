Agile SDLC: Agile is a software development methodology that is incremental and iterative. It places a strong emphasis on teamwork, client input, and flexibility in response to shifting demands. Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP) are examples of agile methodologies.


Benefits:
 
 incredibly adaptable and responsive to shifting needs.

 regular software delivery that functions.
 
 ongoing consumer input and participation.

The particular requirements and characteristics of the project determine which SDLC is best for a term project. But if I had to pick one, the Agile SDLC would be my choice for the reasons listed below:

Flexibility: Term projects frequently have changing goals and specifications. Agile is uniquely equipped to manage these changes without interfering with the development process since it permits regular reevaluation and adaption.

frequent Feedback: It's critical to get feedback from stakeholders or lecturers on a term project on a frequent basis. Agile's iterative methodology guarantees the delivery of functional software in brief cycles, facilitating prompt feedback and modifications.

Possibility for Learning: Agile approaches are frequently applied in the sector. Selecting Agile for your term project will give you invaluable practical experience with an SDLC, which will help you later in life.

Small Team Dynamics: Individuals or small teams are frequently involved in term initiatives. In these kinds of situations, agile techniques like Scrum and Kanban can be used to good advantage.

Agile is a great option, but keep in mind that an SDLC's applicability also depends on the particular needs and features of the project. It is imperative that you thoroughly evaluate the details of your project before settling on a choice.
